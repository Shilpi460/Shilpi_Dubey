# [Project 1: Prediction using supervised machine learning](https://github.com/Shilpi460/Prediction-using-Supervised-ML)
The task was to perform machine learning to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours and calculate the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day. This task involved linear regression.

# [Project 2: Prediction using unsupervised machine learning](https://github.com/Shilpi460/Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML)
* The task stated to predict the optimum number of clusters from given dataset and represent it visually.
* In this task, I have implemented the k-means algorithm  which assigns a point to a cluster by calculating the distance.
* And the optimum number of clusters were determined using the Elbow method.

# [Project 3: Prediction using decision tree algorithm](https://github.com/Shilpi460/Decision-tree-classifier)
It was a machine learning task where I have created a decision tree classifier and visualized it graphically.

# [Project 4: Cyclistic-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success?](https://github.com/Shilpi460/Cyclistic-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success-)
This was a case study where I have to explore Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago and understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
From these insights, I have to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

##### Deliverables for case study:
1.A clear statement of the business task.<br>
2.A description of all data sources used.<br>
3.Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.<br>
4.A summary of your analysis Supporting visualizations and key findings.<br>

# [Project 5: Journalists death analysis](https://github.com/Shilpi460/Journalists-death-analysis)
Journalism is an industry which works day and night to gather information, assess it and provide correct information to the public in the form of news and writings.
But journalists working here even have to sacrifice their lives for collecting right information.

So,CPJ began compiling detailed records on journalist deaths in 1992. CPJ has applied strict journalistic standards when investigating a death.
One important aspect of their research is determining whether a death was work-related. As a result, they classify deaths as "motive confirmed" or "motive unconfirmed".

Exploratory data analysis is the best way to find out the relation between death and the work of journalists.
